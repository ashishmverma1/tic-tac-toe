# Tic-Tac-Toe

An unbeatable Tic-Tac-Toe game
------------------------------
This is a tic-tac-toe game that I have been building using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax">minimax algorithm</a> from game theory, to make it unbeatable.


Tech Stuff Used
---------------
The game is built using HTML5 canvas and jQuery.


Current Progress
----------------
As of now, the game is a two player game with a very basic mouse interface and without any bot.
